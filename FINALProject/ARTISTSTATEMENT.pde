    Dr. T-Rizzle Sick Flow, created by Payton Gilbertson as the final project for CTCH 
  204’s Processing final project is directly inspired by the video posted by 
  drtrizzle69@gmail.com on YouTube with the same name. Based on the book “If Hemingway 
  Wrote JavaScript” by Angus Croll, the original video is a recording of Dr. T-Rizzle 
  performing the piece entitled “Happy Numbers, by Tupac Shakur” to the song I Get 
  Around by Tupac. This piece uses Processing to create an animated music video 
  inspired by the images originally used in the video as well as with a ‘90s style 
  influence. 
  
    During CTCH 204 classes, Dr. T-Rizzle would often reference the book “If Hemingway 
  Wrote JavaScript” by Angus Croll. Due to courses being online, this included dramatic 
  readings from the book to explain differing coding styles based on different writers 
  throughout history. His impeccable musical timing and performance skills led to the 
  creation of the YouTube video this project was inspired by. By incorporating methods 
  used in prior pieces, as well as the addition of new methods created for this piece, 
  the final "music video" was created with a link to the original at the end.
  
    The recreation of the original video using Processing was inspired by animatic 
  videos online of other songs as well as meme culture in general. Dr. T-Rizzle’s 
  performance, being so unplanned and natural lends itself well to the simplistic yet 
  quirky graphics. His overall approach to life being so focused on displaying your 
  authentic self shines through with the images used in the original video, and I felt 
  that replicating that feeling of authenticity through a meme-y lens really captures 
  his performance perfectly. By incorporating images and text from the original piece, 
  I was able to include key parts of Dr. T-Rizzle’s personality and life. Books, code, 
  and memes tend to be mentioned throughout all courses with him, so the inclusion of 
  all three was truly necessary to fully demonstrate him in this form. His love of pixel 
  art is also shown directly in the drawings of him within the piece and mirrors the 
  very pixelated version of the world we currently exist in and have learned all of the 
  used mediums with.
  
    While this piece does not involve a ton of user interactivity, the moving images, 
  text, and shapes build interest through the ever-changing graphics and musical 
  integration. By using similar graphics to ‘90s themed memes that have been popular, 
  Heman for example, this piece is able to break through from just computer science 
  nerds to the rest of the internet. The lyrics, as great as they are, are not the main 
  focus of the piece and thus make it more accessible to a larger community.  
  
    While memes are a constantly changing art form, nostalgia is always appreciated 
  through all forms of media. The ‘90s in particular tend to be an especially nostalgic 
  time for a lot of people, so the use of pixel art and simple graphics draws directly 
  on the nostalgic feelings of that time. Memes typically use a level of ‘cringiness’ 
  to engage audiences, so in the combination of cringe and nostalgia, audiences tend to 
  find enjoyment and humour. It is through this humour that many people are able to 
  relate to a piece and thus share it with others. Many people have old pictures or 
  videos of themselves that they find cringy and nostalgic that we are all able to 
  laugh and find the humour in the past.
  
    Dr. T-Rizzle Sick Flow, through the use of cringy meme-style imagery and nostalgic 
  art styles that an uncomfortable, humorous feeling is created. This feeling is so 
  relatable with young people today, thus growing the audience and sharing the beauty 
  that is Dr. T-Rizzle’s magical voice and image. By sharing this piece, I hope to 
  share the joy and humour of my creation with others and inspire them to create 
  similar works of art.
