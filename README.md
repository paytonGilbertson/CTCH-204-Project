# CTCH-204-Project

**Dr. T-Rizzle Music Video with Processing**

Summary:
As outlined in the syllabus, a significant portion of your grade (40%) is based on a creative programming project. Ultimately what sort of piece you create is up to 
you. It may be something static (like a video) or dynamic (like a video). It may have an interactive component or take no user input whatsoever. You may choose to include audio, external images or even interface with some sort of hardware (like an arduino).

Code Requirements:

 - Your project must be entirely your own work (with the exception of libraries and, in some special cases, graphics). Occasionally, you may find a function, block of code or example that is perfect for what you are trying to do -- if you decide to use this you must cite your sources -- otherwise this is plagiarism. 

- Your project must be done in processing and should draw on a number of methods discussed in class. You are welcome to use methods that were not discussed in class as well. 

- Your projects must be of sufficient complexity to provide a challenge for you and to justify an explanation. 

Write-up (artist statement):

As a block-comment in your main processing file, you should include a ~1000 word artist statement. An artist statement is a written description of your work. 

A good guide for writing an artist statement can be found at gyst-ink.com/artist-statement-guidelines.
